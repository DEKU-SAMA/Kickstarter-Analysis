# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To create a viusal way to access the 
## Analysis and Challenges
Some Challenges that I faced were splitting the cells for the "parent" and "sub-category "categories .
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the graphs below you can see a visual scale of which theatre based kickstarter campiagns were sucessful and unsucessful along the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Number Successful, Failed and Canceled were populated Using COUNTIFS function from Goal amount and Subcatagory, play columns. Then percentage of each outcome was 
calculated. Finally, a line chart was created to visualize the relationship between the goal amount range and the percentage of successful, failed and canceled projects.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The major difficulty I encountere was first with the excel "sheet 1", with creating seperate collumns for the parent category and sub-categories, and this skewed the graph a bit.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One deduction is the number of successful theater events peaks at the month of May and decreases afterwards till December. It increases starting from January. As for the case of failed events it increases throughout the year. Lastly, the canceled occasions are almost constant over the year.

Another conclusion is that, the best time to lucnh an event is the begining of the year. As the rate of the increase of successful events is higher compared to the failed ones.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 Generally, campain at lower goal ranges (0 to 14,999) increase the percentage of successful rate.
 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Data contain missing value; like blurb and the data don't represent all continenets.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Table and graphs can be created to see the relationship between outcomes and years.
